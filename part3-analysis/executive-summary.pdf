1. Performance Snapshot (14 Days)
Top-line
Metric	Value (14 days)	What it tells us
Unique visitors (devices)	~35,300	Healthy interest / reach
Pageviews	45,974	~3.3 pageviews per visitor
Orders (deduped)	290	~21 orders per day
Revenue	≈ 288.8k	~20.6k revenue per day
Average order value (AOV)	≈ 996	Ticket size is strong
Sitewide conversion (views→order)	0.63%	Main weakness: not enough visitors converting
Funnel (site-wide)
From all pageviews over these 14 days:
Step	Count	Rate vs previous step
Pageviews	45,974	–
Add to cart	2,307	5.0% of pageviews
Checkout started	836	36% of add-to-carts
Orders (deduped)	290	34.7% of checkouts
Overall view → order		0.63% of pageviews
Headline:
We have good traffic and AOV, but conversion is low and we’re losing people heavily between cart → checkout → payment.
 
2. What’s Working
2.1 Strong basket economics (AOV)
•	AOV of ~996 is healthy for this category.
•	Revenue is well spread across days; no single outlier spike. 1 March is the best day, but not an anomaly.
•	This means: if we fix conversion, the revenue upside is meaningful without needing much higher traffic.
2.2 Top-of-funnel acquisition
From pageview referrers:
Channel (simplified)	Share of pageviews
Direct	75%
Organic Search	9.6%
Paid / Affiliate	8.9%
Internal navigation	6.0%
Referral + Social	~0.3%
Implications:
•	Brand / direct traffic is strong – three out of four sessions come directly (no external referrer). People know or remember the brand.
•	Paid / Affiliate and Organic Search together drive ~18–19% of traffic, which is meaningful given this is only a 14-day slice.
•	The marketing engine is bringing in high-intent visitors; the main problem is converting them, not finding them.
2.3 Marketing impact on revenue
Using a 7-day lookback:
•	≈26% of orders (76 of 290) had at least one non-direct marketing touch (Paid/Affiliate, Organic Search, Referral) in the last 7 days.
•	Those orders contributed ≈87k in revenue, i.e. about 30% of total revenue.
Among marketing-influenced revenue (~87k):
•	First-click view:
o	~52% from Paid / Affiliate
o	~40% from Organic Search
o	~8% from Referral
•	Last-click view:
o	~63% from Paid / Affiliate
o	~29% from Organic Search
o	~8% from Referral
So:
•	Paid / Affiliate is doing the heavy lifting both in introducing and closing customers.
•	Organic Search is a critical discovery channel and should be actively protected and grown.
•	The remaining ~70% of revenue appears brand-led (direct/internal paths) under this 7-day view, which is a good sign for brand strength.
2.4 Building an owned audience
•	552 email sign-ups (email_filled_on_popup) over 14 days.
•	That is ~1.2% of pageviews converting to email.
This gives us a growing base for flows and remarketing (abandoned cart, winback, cross-sell) – important given the current reliance on direct traffic and paid acquisition.
 
3. What’s Concerning (Where We’re Leaking Value)
3.1 Low overall conversion
•	0.63% view → order is low by typical e-commerce standards.
•	For our AOV, a more sustainable range is 1.5–3%.
•	Even moving from 0.63% → 1.2% would roughly double orders at current traffic.
This is the single biggest performance gap.
3.2 Mid- and bottom-funnel friction
Funnel conversion:
•	5.0% of visitors add a product to cart.
•	But only:
o	36% of carts proceed to checkout, and
o	35% of checkouts turn into completed orders.
In plain language:
Out of 100 people who show serious purchase intent (add to cart), only ~13–14 actually buy.
Likely causes (to be validated with UX and customer feedback):
•	Extra friction in checkout (forms, steps, page load times).
•	Surprise elements at the end:
o	Shipping fees, taxes, or lack of clarity on returns/warranty.
•	Trust & reassurance missing at the moment they enter card details (payment options, security logos, guarantees).
This is where the fastest revenue gains lie: improving the experience from cart → checkout → payment.
3.3 Mobile underperformance
Device performance:
Device	Pageviews	Orders	Conversion (views → order)
Mobile	31,026	180	0.58%
Desktop	12,809	107	0.84%
Other	2,139	3	0.14%
•	Mobile drives about two-thirds of traffic, but converts ~30% worse than desktop.
•	Any improvement here has outsized impact: a 20% relative uplift in mobile conversion would add more revenue than the same uplift on desktop.
Likely areas to investigate:
•	Page load speed on mobile (especially PDP and checkout).
•	Clarity of information above the fold.
•	Placement and size of “Add to Cart” and “Checkout” buttons.
•	Payment UX on mobile (UPI/wallets, autofill, saved cards, etc., depending on market).
3.4 Attribution blind spots
•	Only ~26% of orders can clearly be tied to a non-direct touch within the 7-day window.
•	For marketing decisioning, relying only on last-click will:
o	Over-credit Direct/Internal, and
o	Under-credit Paid / Affiliate and Organic Search, which are clearly driving a big part of first contact.
This doesn’t mean marketing isn’t working; it means our visibility is limited. As we scale spend, getting this right will be essential to avoid cutting channels that are actually profitable.
 
4. Where to Focus Next (Priority Actions)
If management wants maximum impact from this data, the top priorities should be:
1.	Fix the bottom of the funnel (checkout experience)
o	Simplify and streamline checkout steps.
o	Make shipping, taxes, returns, and warranty transparent before payment step.
o	Add strong trust signals (reviews, guarantees, secure payment badges).
2.	Optimise the mobile experience
o	Treat mobile PDP and checkout as the “main store”.
o	Improve load times, readability, and thumb-friendly CTAs.
o	Test mobile-optimised payment options and flows.
3.	Strengthen owned channels (email & remarketing)
o	Build robust email flows: abandoned cart, browse abandonment, post-purchase cross-sell.
o	Given we’re already capturing ~40 emails/day, this can materially improve conversion and repeat purchase.
4.	Use both first-click and last-click views in marketing decisions
o	Last-click to understand what closes sales.
o	First-click to see which channels actually bring new customers into the ecosystem.
o	This prevents us from over-investing in “closer” channels and under-investing in genuine discovery channels like Paid/Affiliate and Organic Search.
 
Bottom line for leadership:
•	The brand already attracts meaningful traffic and strong order values.
•	The main opportunity is to turn more of today’s visitors into buyers, especially on mobile and especially between cart and payment.
•	With relatively modest UX and funnel improvements, plus smarter attribution-driven marketing decisions, this same traffic level can support substantially higher revenue.
