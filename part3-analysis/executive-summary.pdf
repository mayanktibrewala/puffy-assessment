Executive Summary (14 days: 23 Feb 2025 – 8 Mar 2025)

Over this 14-day period, the site generated ~35k unique visitors, ~38k sessions and ~50k events. 
Revenue from deduped orders (unique transaction_ids) was ≈285.5k across 290 orders, giving an AOV ≈ 985.
The business has healthy traffic and AOV, but is clearly constrained by:
   a. Low overall conversion (~0.8% of visitors buy),
   b. Very shallow engagement (most visits are single pageviews),
   c. Over-reliance on “Direct” and Referral traffic, with no measurable paid performance in this dataset.

The opportunity is to improve on-site engagement and checkout completion, and to build scalable, trackable acquisition on top of the current organic + referral base.


1. Business Performance – What’s Working vs. What’s Concerning

   Snapshot of Core Metrics
   Traffic & Orders (14 days)
     a. Visitors (users with pageviews): 33,866
     b. Sessions: 38,268 (≈1.08 sessions per user)
     c. Total events: 49,963
     d. Orders (deduped): 290
     e. Revenue (deduped): 285,516
     f. Average daily revenue: ≈20.4k
     g. AOV: ≈985

   User-level funnel (unique users):
     Stage	                                Users	               % of previous stage
     Visited (page_viewed)	                33,866	                       –
     Added to cart	                        1,961                 	5.8% of visitors
     Started checkout	                     719                 	36.7% of add-to-cart
     Completed purchase                   	285	              39.6% of checkout starters
     Overall visitor → buyer	              285	                   0.8% of visitors

   What’s working
     a. AOV is strong (~985) and relatively consistent, especially for Referral traffic.
     b. Daily revenue is stable, typically 12k–30k per day, without large unexplained drops.
     c. Referral traffic converts best (see §2.2), indicating strong word-of-mouth / partner potential.
     d. Desktop sessions convert better than mobile, suggesting that when people have time and a larger screen, they’re convinced by the offer.

   What’s concerning
     a. Low overall conversion (~0.8%) for a relatively high-intent category.
     b. Very shallow engagement: ~84% of sessions are “bounces” (exactly one page_viewed event, no further action).
     c. Top-of-funnel leakage: only 5.8% of visitors ever add an item to cart.
     d. Checkout leakage: ~60% of users who start checkout don’t complete it.
     e. No paid traffic visible in this 14-day slice (no utm_medium; all orders are “Direct” or “Referral”), limiting scalable growth and optimization.

2. Key Patterns in User Behavior

  2.1 Engagement & On-Site Behavior
     a. Depth:
        i. Events per session: ~1.3
        ii. Events per user: ~1.4
        ⇒ Most visitors see only one page and leave.

     b. Bounce:
        i. ~84% of sessions are a single page_viewed with no add-to-cart, email capture, or checkout. This is the biggest lost opportunity: we’re getting traffic, but very few users engage.

     c. Implication for leadership:
     Treat the landing experience as the main growth lever:
        i. Sharper above-the-fold messaging & social proof
        ii. Clear, visible CTAs (add to cart / view details)
        iii. Lower friction (site speed, mobile layout, popup timing)

   2.2 Device Behavior

       By device (session-level):

          Device	            Sessions	            Purchase sessions	              Session CVR
          Desktop	           11,793	              108	                            0.92%
          Mobile	            26,475	              182	                            0.69%

       Orders & AOV (deduped):

          Device	            Orders	              Revenue	                        AOV
          Desktop	           110	                 114,512	                        1,041
          Mobile	            180	                 171,004	                        950

   Takeaway: Mobile drives most sessions and ~62% of orders, but converts worse and has slightly lower AOV. Improving mobile UX (speed, layout, checkout flow) should have outsized impact on revenue.

3. Marketing & Channel Performance

   Channels are inferred from referrer (no proper UTM tagging):
     a. Direct (no referrer)
     b. Referral (non-search referrers)
     c. Organic Search (google.*)
     d. Social (facebook / instagram)

   3.1 Performance by Entry Channel

    Session-level funnel:

          Channel	             Sessions	               Add Rate	                     Session CVR
          Direct	              28,024	                 5.4%	                         0.76%
          Referral	            6,078	                  5.8%	                         1.02%
          Organic Search	      4,149	                  4.2%	                         0.39%
          Social	              17	                     0%                           	0%
    
    Order-level (deduped):

          Channel	             Orders	                 Revenue                      	AOV
          Direct	              199	                    181,741	                      913
          Referral	            91	                     103,775	                      1,140

4. What This Means for the Business (Priorities for Leadership)

   a. Fix the “one-page visit” problem: ~84% of sessions are single-page visits. Focus on the first page experience: sharper value proposition, stronger social proof, clearer CTAs, and better internal linking to keep users exploring and adding to cart.

   b. Reduce checkout drop-off: Only ~40% of checkout starters complete purchase. Short term: simplify forms and steps, ensure all payment methods work smoothly, and add trust signals (returns, guarantees, secure payment) on checkout screens.

   c. Double-down on high-quality referrals: Referral traffic has the best conversion and highest AOV. Identify top referrers and partners, nurture those relationships, and use their audiences/contexts as a blueprint for future collaborations and ad targeting.

   d. Build a trackable acquisition engine: Today’s data doesn’t show paid performance. Standardize UTM tagging, enable structured tracking across paid search/social, and then use the first-click/last-click models to decide where to scale spend and where to cut.

   e. Prioritize mobile UX: Mobile drives most sessions and orders but converts worse than desktop. Focus on speed, legibility, and frictionless mobile checkout (auto-fill, digital wallets, fewer taps) to unlock incremental conversions from existing traffic.
